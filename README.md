# Firebase Realtime Database: Handling potential null values during deep object access

This repository demonstrates a common issue when accessing deeply nested data in Firebase Realtime Database snapshots and provides a solution to handle potential null values gracefully.

The problem arises when attempting to access a field that might be missing at any level of the nested structure, resulting in an error. The solution utilizes optional chaining and nullish coalescing to safely navigate the nested structure and provide a default value if any level is null or undefined.
